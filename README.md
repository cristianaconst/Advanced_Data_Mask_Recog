# Advanced_Data_Mask_Recog
Dataset and Script for analysing and comparing different methods of machine learning in categorizing faces with/no mask

The project will use basic methods of image processing algorithms for creating different datasets to which will be applied 4 methods of classifying the images with and without masks. There will be added a complexity to the existence/inexistence of the mask.
